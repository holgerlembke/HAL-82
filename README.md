# HAL-82

It is a widely unknown fact that before HAL 9000 was developed there was a small test system build to monitor some devices within the Saugus Ironworks factory. It was called HAL 82.

Little is known about the overall details. Fortunately some parts were rescued from a wall in the factory that only consist of one IO-Modul and a small double-cased processor node. Surprisingly archologists found a surreal modern looking set of compact splicing connectors.
